# ✅ .env File Setup Complete!

## 🔐 Important Security Information:

### ❌ DO NOT Push .env to GitHub!
The `.env` file is **already in `.gitignore`** - it will **NOT** be pushed to GitHub. This is for **security** - your API keys should never be in public repositories!

### ✅ Your API Keys Are Now In:
- **Local `.env` file** - For running the app locally
- **NOT in GitHub** - Safe and secure!

---

## 📋 What You Need to Do for Deployment:

### For Replit:
1. Go to Replit → Click 🔒 **Secrets** (Lock icon)
2. Add each key as a secret:
   - `GROQ_API_KEY` = `<your Groq API key>`
   - `GOOGLE_CSE_API_KEY` = `<your Google CSE API key>`
   - `GOOGLE_API_KEY` = `<your Google API key>`
   - `GOOGLE_CSE_ID` = `<your Google CSE ID>`
   - `HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY` = `<your Hugging Face API key>`
   - `SERP_API_KEY` = `<your SerpAPI key>`

### For Render.com:
1. Go to your service → **Environment** tab
2. Add each variable with the same values above

---

## ✅ Your .env File Contains:
- ✅ GROQ_API_KEY
- ✅ GOOGLE_CSE_API_KEY
- ✅ GOOGLE_API_KEY
- ✅ GOOGLE_CSE_ID
- ✅ HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY
- ✅ SERP_API_KEY

---

## 🚀 Next Steps:

1. **Local Development**: Your app will now use keys from `.env` file ✅
2. **Replit/Render**: Add keys as secrets/environment variables (see above)
3. **GitHub**: `.env` is ignored - safe to push code! ✅

---

## ⚠️ Why Keys Were Removed from Code:

GitHub's security system detected your API keys in the code and **blocked the push**. This is a **good security feature**! 

- ✅ Keys are now in `.env` (local only)
- ✅ `.env` is in `.gitignore` (won't be pushed)
- ✅ Safe to push code to GitHub
- ✅ Add keys manually to deployment platforms

---

## 🎉 You're All Set!

Your app will now work locally with the `.env` file, and you can deploy to Replit/Render by adding the keys as secrets/environment variables.
